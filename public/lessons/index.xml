      <description>Pre-Processing data in R with the Iris Dataset ðŸ“˜ Overview Data pre-processing is an important part of any aspect of data analysis. Regardless of what field of study you may find yourself in, ensuring the validity of your data is paramount to establishing a credible basis to your work. Otherwise, it can lead to inaccurate results and provide you with the wrong information for your project or study.&#xA;For this lesson, letâ€™s work with the built-in iris dataset, which contains data on 50 iris flowers across different species of iris flowers. Each entry contains the following measurements for the flowers:</description>

      <description>Data Cleaning and Visualization in R ðŸ“˜ Overview Data cleaning is a crucial first step in any data analysis project. It is estimated that 80% of a data scientistâ€™s work involves data preparation, with around 60% of that time dedicated to cleaning and organizing data.&#xA;In this lesson, we will use the nycflights13::flights dataset to learn practical data cleaning and visualization techniques. This dataset contains over 300,000 flights departing from New York City in 2013.</description>
