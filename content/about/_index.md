#### Hey Researchers in Data at Allegheny College!

If you are a student or faculty at Allegheny College and you need some help with your analysis, then we can help you set-up your analysis in your project.

As members of the Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College, we often complete computational work and analyses for classes, senior thesis projects, and for other areas. We understand that there are many complex and often frustrating steps in computation that must be handled before the larger steps of the analytical project can be started. Our service is here to assist students and faculty with the technical aspects of their research, providing support to get you started and guiding you through the process.

While we do not complete your work for you, nor do we promise to complete all your project's computer code, we _can_ meet with you to brainstorm solutions to overcome the computational challenges of your project in analysis. Our help desk is made up of talented students in computing who can offer solutions for completing the following types of tasks.

+ **Coding and debugging**: The creation of parts of code that will be used to complete some computatioan task.
+ **Data Wrangling**: The process of cleaning, organizing, and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis.
+ **Programming Support**: Whether you’re working in Python, R, or another language, our students can assist in writing and debugging code to fit your research needs.
+ **Statistical Modeling**: Design and implementation of statistical models to analyze data effectively and draw meaningful conclusions. 
+ **Visualization**: Creation of informative plots and graphs that help illustrate the findings of your research.
+ **And More**: Got a question about the a computational step in a project? Then stop by one of our help desks and ask!

Our goal is to enhance your research by providing the technical support necessary to navigate the computational aspects of your project. Whether you're unsure how to get started with data analysis or need guidance with more advanced tasks, we’re here to help you succeed in your project of computational analysis.
