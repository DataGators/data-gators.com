##### Sherlock Holmes once said,

## Data! Data! Data!

### I can't make bricks without clay.

The DataGators maintain that this fact is quite true, however, if given the data, how would Sherlock actually build his bricks??

There is the same type trouble in data science research -- once you have the data, **then what**?! 

+ How do you start the project from a spreadsheet of *stuff*??
+ How to make something amazing from a file filled with who-knows-what?!

Come talk to the DataGators to get some ideas about how to work with your data. Before long, you will have your foundation ready for brick building!

## Who Are the Gators?

I once heard that the DataGators team turned down Nobel Prizes since there was no room left in their trophy cabinets for more *stuff*. Amazing! But who are these remarkable people that make up the DataGators team? How do they know data so well? Find out here about makes them so [illustrious](http://www.data-gators.com/contacts/gators/)!
