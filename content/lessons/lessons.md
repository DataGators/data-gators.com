# Data Gators Tutorials

This repository is intended to contain R-Code tutorials for the Data Gators. The tutorials are intended to be educational and example code for students learning R, as well as for students interested in learning more about the language that are not part of the computer science and information science department directly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **R**
- R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

  - [Click here to install R on your computer (WINDOWS)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
  - [Click here to install R on your computer (MAC)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
  - [Click here to install R on your computer (LINUX)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)
- **RStudio**
- RStudio is a free, open-source, cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

  - [Click here to install RStudio on your computer (ALL PLATFORMS)](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- VSCode (optional). RStudio also works as an environment to code in, but VSCode is easier to use for some people. Do note that VSCode is a multilingual platform for coding, while RStudio is specifically made with R in mind.

### Repository Set-Up

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following link: [Data Gators Tutorial 1: Data Loading and Pre-Processing]()
2. Open the repository in RStudio (you can also use VSCode if you like).
3. Run the code in the `tutorial-01-preprocessing.r` file to get started with the tutorial(s). Be sure to read the comments to learn more about the code. And don't be afraid to make your own changes to test out the code and see how it affects the code!
