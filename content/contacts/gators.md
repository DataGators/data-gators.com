**Orion**

Hi, I'm Orion. I'm a data scientist, and I've got plenty of experience with data analysis. I work primarily with Python, R, Dart, and Java. I love data analytics, machine learning, and statistical analysis. I enjoy the rigor of breaking down datasets, ripping them apart to their bits and learning what makes them tick to create tools that aid proper decision making when consulting such data. I'm always looking for the next breakthrough to work on, whether it be working with data processing, or developing a machine learning model. -->

**Oliver Bonham-Carter, Ph.D.**

email: __obonhamcarter(A)allegheny(dot)edu__

Hi I am an Associate Professor at Allegheny College in the Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS). I am honored to be a part of this great team of thinkers! I teach Data Science, Database Systems and other courses where SQL, R programming and Python play central roles. Much of my research involves (you guessed it) data and computational, mathematical and statistical analysis. My recent work involved building an engin to connect parallel ideas from articles across the millions of scientific publications that are curated by National Center for Biotechnology Information and PubMed. Yummy!
