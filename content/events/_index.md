### What to expect

🌟 Even the greatest of (data) scientists had to get their start _somewhere_. While it was unlikely their entrance into the __research spotlight__ of the world's stage, came by-way of a DataGators event (_although never say never!_), their start must have come from a similar type of event! Come, and get your start with us at a data science workshop where we cover some of the steps that will help you to work with data and to create your own results. Cool, right?!

### Some of the pre-highlights include, but are not limited to
