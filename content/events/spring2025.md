### What to expect

🌟 Even the greatest of (data) scientists had to get their start _somewhere_. While it was unlikely their entrance into the __research spotlight__ of the world's stage, came by-way of a DataGators event (_although never say never!_), their start must have come from a similar type of event! Come, and get your start with us at a data science workshop where we cover some of the steps that will help you to work with data and to create your own results. Cool, right?!

### Some of the pre-highlights include, but are not limited to

An Illustrious DataGator will share the secrets of the Data Scientists to get you started by guiding you through some of the basics and even beyond!

- 📈 Hone your skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Who knows? You might discover your new favorite data tool!
- 🎉 Discover the power of R or Python programming and learn to wrangle, clean and analyze your data like a pro!
- 💻 Learn how to work with analysis, tools and create visualizations.
- 🚀 Explore hacks and other possibilities that you can put to use in your senior thesis research project(s)!
- 🌐 Connect with fellow enthusiasts, share insights, and build a network of Data Science aficionados!

### What to bring

Bring your laptop, your curiosity, and your enthusiasm! We will provide the rest!

## Cannot Attend But Still Interested?

If you can't make it to the live sessions but would still like to get some idea about your project, then drop by our HelpDesk sessions on Fridays from 12:00pm to 1:00pm in the Pell Classroom. We're here to help you with your data science needs!
