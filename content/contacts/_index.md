##### Sherlock Holmes once said,

## Data! Data! Data!

### I can't make bricks without clay

Sherlock Holmes first said this when he was working on a case and did not have the necessary data and information to continue his unraveling of the case. The DataGators maintain that this fact also is quite true. In absence of the initial data, information and other resources, how can a project be carried to conclusion? Asked another way, if given the necessary data, how could Sherlock actually build the bricks to a foundation of his research??

There is the same type trouble in data science research -- once you have the data, **then what**?! 

+ How do you start the project from a spreadsheet of *stuff*??
+ How to make something amazing from a file filled with who-knows-what?!

Come talk to the DataGators to get some ideas about how to work with your data. Before long, you will have your foundation ready for brick building!

## Who Are The Gators?

I once heard that the DataGators team turned down Nobel Prizes since there was no room left in their trophy cabinets for more *stuff*. Amazing! But who are these remarkable people that make up the DataGators team? How do they know data so well? How can they be helpful to others who are in the midst of working on data-intensive research? The Illustrious DataGators are strong students from Allegheny College's Department of Computer and Information Science. The members of team have an excellent understanding of how to use data, statistical methods, programming, and other resources to complete research projects. And they would love to share their wealth of knowledge with you for your own project in research for your classes or senior thesis work!
